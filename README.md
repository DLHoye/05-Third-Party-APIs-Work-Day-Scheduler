Hi there! 

Follow the link below to open a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This calendar uses the Moment.js library to work with date/time and make sure you're not late for that all important meeting/hunny-do list!

Once you've entered an event into the hourly time blocks, click the save button so you don't lose your stuff! 

At the end of the day the calendar will clear itself and you can start alllllll over again!
